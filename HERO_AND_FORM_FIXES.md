# Hero Section and Contact Form Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hero Section Text Visibility
**Problem**: Text was invisible against the gradient background
**Solution**: 
- Changed hero title color to white with text shadow
- Changed hero description color to white with text shadow
- Updated gradient text to use lighter colors (yellow-orange) with text shadow
- Added proper contrast for readability

### 2. Missing Contact Form
**Problem**: Contact form was hidden on all screen sizes
**Solution**:
- Removed `display: none` rule from contact form CSS
- Changed to `padding: 1rem` for better mobile display
- Form is now visible and functional

### 3. WhatsApp Number Updates
**Problem**: Old WhatsApp number still referenced in some places
**Solution**:
- Updated all remaining references from `+91-8851193731` to `+61-423119396`
- Updated both contact section and footer

### 4. Address Updates
**Problem**: Generic address still in footer
**Solution**:
- Updated footer address from "Your Location, City, State" to "Dandenong, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"
- Matches the address already updated in contact section

## CSS Changes Made
